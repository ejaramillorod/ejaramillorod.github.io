Linear Algebra. Lead Instructor: David Marsico.

## Resources:

I prepared some handwritten [notes](/files/math22a/22a-notes) covering Determinants, Eigenvalues/ Eigenvectors, and Diagonalization
to help students prepare for the final. They also contain some exercises, for which I also wrote [partial solutions](/files/math22a/22a-notes-solutions).
