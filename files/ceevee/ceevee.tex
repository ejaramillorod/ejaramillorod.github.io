I was responsible for creating the syllabus, compiling reading materials, producing exercises to guide readings, and facilitating discussions. Topics covered: Linear Regression/ Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression, LASSO regression, Singular Value Decomposition/ Principle Component Analysis, and implementations of these methods in Python for applications to predicting home prices and 
image compression}{}{}{}{}
