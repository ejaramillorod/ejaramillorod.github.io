This is the personal site of Edgar Jaramillo Rodriguez.
I am a PhD candidate in Math at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD Math"); my advisor is [Jesus De Loera](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/ "Jesus De Loera").
I earned my MS in Mathematics from UC Davis in 2021, and earned my BA in Applied Mathematics from [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/ "UCB Math") in 2018.
I am also a passionate educator and an advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion.

# Research

My research is in applied and computational *discrete mathematics*, with an emphasis on *optimization* and *data science*.
My PhD thesis is focused on developing connections between combinatorics and persistent homology, a key tool in topological data analysis.
In addition to my PhD work, I have also conducted research for Los Alamos National Lab as a graduate intern in the Information Systems and Modeling Group (A-1). This research focused on solving discrete optimization problems on graphs for applications to epidemiology.
<!-- I outline these projects and some potential future directions in my [research statement](/files/ceevee/ceevee.pdf "cv"). -->

 I am always interested in meeting others working in these or related topics. Please feel free to reach out if you are looking for collaborators, have questions for me, or just want to say hi!
