I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Math at UC Davis; my advisor is Jesus De Loera. My research is in stochastic combinatorial geometry; basically I use probability, combinatorics, and convex geometry to try to say things about random data. I am also a passionate educator and an advocate for making math more inclusive for students belonging to marginalized groups.
