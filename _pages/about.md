This is the personal site of Elena Jaramillo Rodriguez.
I am Solutions Engineering Analyst in Government and Public Services at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html). My offering portfolio is in Artificial Intelligence and Data Operations.

In June 2023 I received my PhD in Mathematics at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD Math"); my advisor was [Jesus De Loera](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/ "Jesus De Loera").
I previously earned my MS in Mathematics from UC Davis in 2021 and my BA in Applied Mathematics from [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/ "UCB Math") in 2018.

# Research

My research focused on applied and computational *discrete mathematics*, with an emphasis on *optimization* and *data science*.
In my PhD thesis, I developed connections between combinatorics and persistent homology, a key tool in topological data analysis.
In addition to my PhD work, I also conducted research for Los Alamos National Lab as a graduate intern in the Information Systems and Modeling Group (A-1). This research focused on solving discrete optimization problems on graphs for applications to epidemiology.
<!-- I outline these projects and some potential future directions in my [research statement](/files/ceevee/ceevee.pdf "cv"). -->

 I am always interested in meeting others working in these or related topics. Please feel free to reach out if you are looking for collaborators, have questions for me, or just want to say hi!
