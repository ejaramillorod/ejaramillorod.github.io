Welcome! This is the personal site of Edgar Jaramillo Rodriguez.
I am a PhD candidate in Math at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD Math"); my advisor is [Jesus De Loera](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/ "Jesus De Loera"). My research is in stochastic combinatorial geometry. I use probability, combinatorics, and convex geometry to describe the shape of data. I am also a passionate educator and an advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion.
