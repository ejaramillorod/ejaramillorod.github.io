Welcome! This is the personal site of Edgar Jaramillo Rodriguez.
I am a PhD candidate in Math at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD Math"); my advisor is [Jesus De Loera](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/ "Jesus De Loera").
I earned my MS in Mathematics from UC Davis in 2021, and earned my BA in Applied Mathematics from [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/ "UCB Math") in 2018.

My research is in stochastic combinatorial geometry. I use probability, combinatorics, and convex geometry to describe the shape of data. I am also a passionate educator and an advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion.
