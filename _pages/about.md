This is the personal site of Edgar Jaramillo Rodriguez.
I am a PhD candidate in Math at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/ "UCD Math"); my advisor is [Jesus De Loera](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/ "Jesus De Loera").
I earned my MS in Mathematics from UC Davis in 2021, and earned my BA in Applied Mathematics from [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/ "UCB Math") in 2018.
I am also a passionate educator and an advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion.

# Research

My research is in combinatorial probability, data science, and mathematical optimization. For my thesis I have mainly researched _barcodes_, which are collections of intervals on the real line. Barcodes arise naturally in the study of interval graphs and in topological data analysis (TDA). My work studies the distributions of random barcodes under certain models as well as the combinatorial structure of barcodes for TDA.

Since June of 2022, I have been interning with Los Alamos National Lab, under the mentorship of [Sara del Valle](https://public.lanl.gov/sdelvall/), [Geoffrey Fairchild](https://www.gfairchild.com/), and [Nidhi Parikh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z7rCEYYAAAAJ&hl=en). I have been working with [Axel Browne](https://github.com/axelbrowne) on optimal surveillance and intervention strategies on networks for applications to epidemiology. In addition to performing the research I have also been working as a developer to implement these methods so they are scalable to massive networks with millions of nodes and billions of edges.

The main tools I use come from probability, graph theory, combinatorics, mathematical optimization, and algebraic topology. I am always interested in meeting others working in these or related fields. Please feel free to reach out if you are looking for collaborators, have questions for me, or just want to say hi!
