I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Math at UC Davis. My advisor is Jesus De Loera. My research is in stochastic combinatorial geometry; basically I use probability, combinatorics, and convex geometry to try to say things about random data. My favorite type of project is one where I can work with data and prove theorems. I'm always looking for new collaborators so feel free to reach out!
